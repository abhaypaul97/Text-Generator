# Text-Generator
Can be used to predict next char or next n chars.
The user has to give context and data to train the model. The no of letter to be considered for training the model is to be given by the user( Ex 3, 4, 5).
Very High value numbers wouldn't make sense as most of words fall in 3-10 letter range.
Basically it'll predict the next letter or n letters as per the user input (taking probability weightage in the given data).
